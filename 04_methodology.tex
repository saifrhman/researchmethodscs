The aim of this paper

\subsection{PRISMA Chart}
In the first stage of our scoping review, we identified records from five major 
databases. The initial search produced a combined set of studies, with the number 
of records obtained from each source presented in Figure X. Twenty-nine records 
were removed during initial organisation upon determining that Nature, being a 
publisher rather than a database, produced duplicated entries across our other 
information sources.

During screening, we identified a number of non-English 
records and further duplicates. Because our institution offers full-text access 
to all searched databases, none of the records were were excluded due to retrieval 
limitations.
