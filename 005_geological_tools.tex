\section{Geological Survey Tools and Data Acquisition Technologies}

Mangrove ecosystems are monitored using a diverse suite of geospatial sensing technologies, each capturing distinct and complementary attributes of forest condition (physiological stress, drought, etc,) or structure (plant height and density, topological features, etc.)\cite{aparicio_ai-based_2025}, \cite{leal_state_2024}. No single sensing modality among the retrieved papers provides a complete description of mangrove ecosystems, making multimodal integration a notable hole in the field, and a milestone for conservation science.

Thus, a holistic representation would refer to a joint latent encoding that simultaneously captures forest extent, vertical structure, physiological condition, hydrological dynamics, and temporal change, enabling restoration prioritisation based on both current state and predicted developments.

Figure 2 provides an overview of the major sensing modalities used in mangrove studies and the ecological attributes they capture. The matrix highlights that individual sensing modalities provide partial and complementary views of mangroves.

Several clear trends emerge from Table 2. First, satellite-based and airborne optical and radar systems dominate mangrove research. High-resolution aerial imagery and SAR-based platforms (particularly ALOS-PALSAR) appear most frequently. This is likely due to the need to assess large geographical spaces and relying on inundation dynamics to classify mangrove ecosystems.

Noticeably, advanced sensing modalities such as LiDAR and hyperspectral imaging remain comparatively underrepresented, despite their demonstrated ability to capture three-dimensional structure, species composition, and biochemical traits \cite{li_mapping_2021}, \cite{fu_cross-scenario_2025}. This suggests that while high-fidelity structural and functional data are recognised as valuable, their integration into mainstream mangrove monitoring workflows remains limited, likely due to cost, availability, and analytical complexity.

Third, the relatively low representation of Landsat compared to SAR-based and aerial platforms reflects a gradual shift away from coarse optical imagery toward sensors better suited to cloud-prone dynamic coastal environments. Overall, these patterns indicate a strong dependence on a narrow subset of sensing technologies, which further states the need for multimodal integration to capture the full complexity of mangrove ecosystems.

\subsection{Optical Multispectral Remote Sensing}
Optical multispectral imagery from platforms such as Landsat and Sentinel-2 remains the most widely used data source for mangrove monitoring. These sensors support vegetation indices, phenological analysis, and land-cover classification \cite{bunting_global_2022}. Sentinel-2's red-edge bands enhance discrimination between mangrove vegetation and adjacent land covers but remain susceptible to cloud cover and atmospheric interference \cite{zhang_fragmangro_2025}.

\subsection{Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)}

Satellite Aperture Radar (SAR) consists of satellite
imagery obtained by using sensors capable of utilising other bands of the electromagnetic spectrum.
Depending on the bandwidths used by said sensors
the images may be classified as multispectral (about
3 to 10 wide bands within the range of 0.43 um to 12
12.51 um) or hyperspectral (a couple hundred narrow
bands in the range of 0.4 to 2.5 um) [8]. The usage of
these tools was evaluated by Kwon and collaborators,
and yielded promising results
SAR sensors provide cloud-independent observations and sensitivity to vegetation structure, moisture, and inundation dynamics. Sentinel-1 and ALOS PALSAR have proven effective for mangrove delineation in persistently cloudy regions and for detecting fragmented or narrow forest stands \cite{ghorbanian_weakly_2025}. SAR's ability to capture tidal and hydrological dynamics makes it particularly valuable for restoration suitability assessments.

\subsection{LiDAR}
LiDAR remote sensing is performed by low altitude aircraft equipped with light lasers; as the aircraft flies at constant speed, the sensor emits light
and measures the time it takes to rebound, creating
a 3D model of the scanned surface. It may struggle
to get accurate plant resolution with multilatered,
dense, tall forests.

\subsection{Hyperspectral and Thermal Infrared Sensors}
Hyperspectral data support species-level discrimination and biochemical trait estimation, while thermal infrared data reveal physiological stress and hydrological anomalies \cite{farella_thermal_2022}, \cite{fu_cross-scenario_2025}. These modalities are underutilised in large-scale mangrove studies but offer significant potential for early stress detection and restoration monitoring.

\subsection{UAV-Based Observations}
UAV platforms provide ultra-high spatial resolution imagery for local-scale assessment and validation. While invaluable for monitoring restoration sites, UAV data lack scalability and require integration with satellite-based observations.
