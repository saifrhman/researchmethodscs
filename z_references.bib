	abstract = {This study summarizes the advances in mangrove species mapping based on multispectral and hyperspectral imagery achieved over the last decade. The influence of species diversity and sensor specifications on the performances of various classification approaches are discussed. Based on the limitations of previous approaches, we propose a novel framework to map mangrove species at medium, high, and very-high spatial resolution using multispectral and hyperspectral images. The framework relies on a multitask convolutional neural network to achieve accurate classification at pixel and object (i.e. individual tree crown) level. It was successfully applied to the most comprehensive dataset of optical imagery ever collected over a mangrove forest, achieving accurate mapping of species on airborne ({OA} = 95 \%, Kappa = 0.93) and spaceborne imagery ({OA} and Kappa up to 97 \% and 0.95, respectively), including the newly-operating hyperspectral {DESIS} and {PRISMA} instruments. This study brings new insights into the role of spatial and spectral resolutions in mangrove species classification, particularly the importance of short-wave infrared bands. Multispectral imagery performs well at very-high to high resolutions (up to 10–20 m) but suffers from the lack of spectral information at medium resolution (30 m). Hyperspectral imagery provided the best results at sub-metric resolution (0.5 m) and satisfactory results at 30-m resolution ({OA} ≥ 85), and could benefit from implementing spectral unmixing in the latter case. Given the increasing attention accorded to mangroves, remote sensing will undoubtedly become an essential tool to monitor the diversity of these endangered ecosystems in the future. In that respect, efforts should concentrate on evaluating the capabilities of new and upcoming instruments and multisource data combination to improve mangrove species mapping and, more broadly, to meet conservation goals.},

	abstract = {Mangrove canopy height information is crucial to carbon stock and biomass analyses. However, estimation of this height is challenging because of the large areas involved, and the field conditions of mangrove forests. Remote sensing satellite imagery has been used for canopy height mapping because it offers several advantages. This study developed a spatial–spectral–temporal deep learning regression model with convolutional long short-term memory ({ConvLSTM}) and transformer (hereafter referred to as the {SST}-{CLT} model) to map mangrove canopy height over a large area. The {SST}-{CLT} model consists of two submodels trained simultaneously. The first submodel is a fusion extractor to extract spatial–spectral–temporal information from Sentinel-1 time-series data by using a {ConvLSTM}. It also extracts spatial–spectral information from Sentinel-2 data using a 2-D convolutional block. The second submodel is a regressor that contains a Swin transformer ({SWINTF}) and a final convolutional regression layer. Data from the light detection and ranging ({LiDAR}) canopy height model ({CHM}) were employed as the target data to train the proposed model. The {SST}-{CLT} model was tested on two datasets collected from Florida: a large dataset for the Everglades National Park ({ENP}) and a small dataset for the Charlotte Harbor Preserve State Park ({CHPSP}). The {SST}-{CLT} model achieved a mean absolute error ({MAE}) of 1.924 and 1.913 m for the {ENP} and {CHPSP} datasets, respectively. Moreover, it achieved root mean square error ({RMSE}) values of 2.471 and 2.440 m for these datasets, respectively. The {SST}-{CLT} model was compared with that of other regression models. The results indicated that the {MAE} and {RMSE} of the proposed {SST}-{CLT} were lower than those of the other models (https://github.com/ilhamjamaluddin/{SSTCLT}).},

	abstract = {Collaboration between Light Detection and Ranging ({LiDAR}) point clouds and deep learning has been proven to be an effective approach for vegetation mapping. Current studies have predominantly focused on 2D vegetation mapping, whereas 3D mapping, which directly classifies point clouds at point level, offers a more comprehensive understanding of the stratified structural information of vegetation. However, there is a lack of research on 3D vegetation species mapping, and the disparities between 2D and 3D mapping in natural scenarios remain unclear. To resolve these issues, we compared the deep learning performance of 2D and 3D vegetation species mapping across three distinct natural scenes: karst wetland, mangrove forest, and hill forest. In addition, the 2D and 3D mapping in natural scenes are adversely affected by the elevated channel count of {LiDAR}-derived features and the extreme category imbalance in point cloud. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a novel Multi-resolution Feature Selection Network ({MrFSNet}) to select optimal feature combinations at different scales for better 2D mapping performance. Additionally, we introduce a novel Dynamic Weighted Sampling ({DWS}) strategy, which is combined with {KPConv} to address the extreme category imbalance present in 3D mapping. Results indicate that: (1) 3D vegetation species mapping exhibited the highest performance, achieving an {mF}1 of 89.78\% for karst wetland, 92.25\% for mangrove forest, and 92.05\% for hill forest. (2) 3D mapping outperformed 2D mapping, improving {mF}1 by 3.43\% to 27.08\%. (3) {MrFSNet} adaptively extracted optimal features at various scales and performed well with the limited training data in 2D vegetation mapping, resulting in a 1.66\%–18.46\% higher {mF}1 than that of Swin Transformer. (4) {DWS} effectively resolved the extreme category imbalance problem and produced 1.28\%–2.80\% higher {mF}1 than the non-{DWS} version in 3D vegetation mapping.},

	abstract = {Understanding species distribution and canopy structure of mangrove forests is imperative for flora and fauna conservation in mangrove habitats. However, most mangrove studies focused on the top canopy layer without exploring the vertical structure of mangroves. This paper presents multi-layered mangrove mapping which considered both overstory and understory detection and species classification using multispectral {WorldView}-3 ({WV}-3) data, airborne hyperspectral images ({HSI}), and {LiDAR} point cloud. First, {LiDAR} returns were stratified into the overstory and understory by analyzing the profile of return height, which helped understand the vertical structure of the mangrove stands. Second, three classification algorithms Random Forest ({RF}), Support Vector Machine ({SVM}), and Convolutional Neural Network ({CNN}) were compared by applying {WV}-3, {HSI}, {LiDAR} data, and their combinations to map seven vegetative species. Feature selection was conducted to identify important features and the optimal feature size prior to classification tasks. The measured and estimated understory canopy heights reached a high correlation coefficient of 0.71, which demonstrated the effectiveness of using {LiDAR} data and the proposed procedure to stratify multi-layered canopies. The combined {HSI} and {LiDAR} data produced satisfactory results by the three classifiers with overall accuracy ({OA}) varying from 0.86 to 0.88. And the species was also accurately mapped by integrating {WV}-3 and {LiDAR} data using both {RF} and {SVM} algorithms with {OA} attaining between 0.84 and 0.86. The results of this study highlight that (1) {LiDAR} data provided superior information to map the vertical structure of multi-layered mangroves, which provided valuable information to classify single-layered and dual-layered Kandelia obovata with understory beneath; (2) the combination of spectral and {LiDAR} features improved mangrove species classification; (3) and species mapping results derived from combined datasets appeared to be more influential by {LiDAR} features when using {RF} and {SVM}, but spectral features played a more important role in {CNN}.},

	abstract = {Mangrove forests are vulnerable ecosystems that require broad-scale monitoring. Various solutions based on satellite imagery have emerged for this purpose but still suffer from the lack of methods to accurately delineate individual tree crowns ({ITCs}). Within-stand variability in crown size and shape, crown clumping and fragmentation, and understory vegetation hamper the delineation in these ecosystems. To cope with these factors, the proposed method combines a deep learning-based enhancement of {ITCs} with a marker-controlled watershed segmentation algorithm. The {MT}-{EDv}3 neural network is employed to compute the normalized Euclidean distance of crown pixels to treetops and a Laplacian of Gaussian filter is applied to the resulting image to enhance crown borders before segmentation. The method was applied to {WorldView} imagery over four mangrove sites worldwide and compared to previously published methods using standardized metrics. Accurate detection (Overall Accuracy ≥ 0.93 and Kappa ≥ 0.87) and area estimation (R2 ≥ 0.66, {NRMSE} ≤ 12\%) of crowns was achieved for all sites using either the panchromatic band or a combination of the pan-sharpened visible-nearinfrared bands. Based on Precision, Recall, and F1-score, the proposed method outperformed previous watershed segmentation and software-based algorithms of crown delineation, as well as the Mask R-{CNN} segmentation framework. The viewing geometry of images and the forest heterogeneity were identified as important contributors to the delineation accuracy. This study is the first to achieve accurate delineation of {ITCs} in mangrove forests across sites, opening perspectives of applications to satellite-based monitoring. The method shows promising transferability to other very-high-resolution satellite sensors as well as to aerial and unmanned aerial vehicle imagery and could be improved by including more spectral information and {LiDAR}-derived canopy height models.},

To address these issues, we propose {FragMangro}, a cross-domain zero-shot detection model designed to enhance the accuracy and generalization of mangrove detection. {FragMangro} integrates parallel multi-scale convolution for progressive dimensional upscaling, improving spectral feature extraction. Additionally, it employs a dynamic learning rate and iterative control algorithm, which adaptively adjusts learning rates and training epochs based on loss monitoring to prevent suboptimal convergence. We conducted extensive experiments in three major mangrove reserves in Guangxi, China. The results demonstrate that {FragMangro} achieves over 98\% accuracy, an average F1 Score exceeding 85\%, and the Intersection over Union({IoU}) surpassing 74\%, significantly outperforming conventional methods such as support vector machines ({SVM}), random forests ({RF}), and k-nearest neighbors ({KNN}). Specifically, in the Beilun estuary, {FragMangro} exhibits a 0.96\% improvement in accuracy over {RF}, a 17.24\% higher F1 Score than {SVM}, and an 18.08\% higher {IoU} than {KNN}. Furthermore, the model’s adaptive learning rate and dynamic adjustment strategy enhance convergence efficiency and feature representation. {FragMangro} serves as an effective tool for ecological monitoring and mangrove conservation, with broader implications for environmental protection and sustainable ecosystem management.},

Despite growing interest in mangrove {AGB} estimation using a remote sensing approach, the effectiveness of this advanced method has not been evaluated for mangrove forests in Myanmar. This study estimated the {AGB} of Wunbaik Mangrove Forest ({WMF}) in Myanmar using machine learning models with data from Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1, and Advanced Land Observing Satellite Phased Arrayed L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar ({ALOS}-{PALSAR}) {HH} and {HV} polarizations and Canopy Height Model. Reference {AGB} information was derived from field inventory plots via an allometric equation. Initially, we tested machine learning models such as Random Forest ({RF}), Support Vector Machine ({SVM}), and Extreme Gradient Boost ({XGBoost}). The results revealed that the {RF} model outperformed the other models, yielding a higher coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.33 and a Root Mean Square Error ({RMSE}) of 32.05 Mg ha−1. We then set up different scenarios to improve the performance of the {RF} model for {AGB} estimation. Through different feature selection approaches, we identified features highly correlated with the field {AGB}, enhancing the {RF} model’s performance and resulting in the highest improvement in R2: 0.48 and {RMSE}: 28.12 Mg ha−1. In this study, an {AGB} map of the {WMF} was generated using the best {RF} model. The predicted {AGB} distribution ranged from 22.266 Mg ha−1 to 181.948 Mg ha−1 in 2019. Compared with global datasets such as {GEDI} L4B and {ESA} {CCI} predictions, the proposed method provides a more accurate prediction of {AGB} for Wunbaik Mangrove, enhancing blue carbon information in Myanmar.},

This study employed a weakly supervised deep learning framework for semantic segmentation of the ecosystem by integrating time-series Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery with an existing ecosystem map as weak labels. This approach incorporates a U-Net architecture with an {EfficientNet}-B7 backbone for robust feature extraction, employs Test-Time Augmentation ({TTA}) with an ensemble strategy to enhance prediction stability, and validates the method’s temporal transferability across multiple years. The model achieved high accuracy in the baseline year (2020), with 95.56\% overall accuracy according to independent reference samples, and successfully generated noise-free maps despite imperfect training data. The {TTA} approach improved the final map both visually and statistically compared to a simple prediction approach. Visual comparisons with high-resolution satellite imagery, an existing ecosystem map, and a recent global mangrove extent dataset confirmed the superior performance of our proposed workflow in mangrove mapping. The temporal transferability of the model, examined in 2017 and 2023 using the baseline model with no modification, confirmed its applicability by generating the ecosystem maps meticulously, though the predictive uncertainty value increased. The generated multitemporal maps indicated a mangrove extent expansion of about 3.43\% between 2017 and 2023. This straightforward workflow facilitates automatic mangrove ecosystem mapping and updating while effectively reducing the need for frequent reference sample collection, especially in cloud-prone areas. The temporal capability of the approach offers practical solutions for large-scale mangrove ecosystem conservation initiatives.},

	abstract = {The integration of artificial intelligence ({AI}) algorithms in ecological research is revolutionizing how we monitor, predict, and manage natural systems, enabling more advanced data analysis, pattern recognition, and predictive modelling. This review critically analyzes and synthesizes the application of machine learning and deep learning in terrestrial ecology, providing a comprehensive overview of their paradigms – namely unsupervised, supervised, and reinforcement learning – and semi-supervised learning, along with their respective algorithm families, strengths, and limitations. We examine both current and emerging applications in terrestrial ecological dynamics and modelling, ecosystem management and conservation, identification and classification tasks, such as trait and behavior recognition. Despite these advancements, we summarize several issues hindering the extensive adoption of {AI} algorithms in ecology, such as inconsistencies or limitations in datasets, algorithm complexity and interpretability affecting transparency and reliability, high computational demands raising environmental sustainability concerns, and difficulties with model generalization. To address these barriers, we identify key areas for future research, namely optimizing data collection, using transfer learning and data augmentation, refining model transparency through explainable {AI} ({XAI}) and ethical considerations, and integrating causal inference into {AI} models. We conclude that {AI} algorithms hold great promise for delivering more accurate, scalable, and timely data, advancing real-time monitoring and near-instantaneous predictions – e.g., seasonal forecasting – for more dynamic responses to environmental changes. The need for continued methodological innovation and multi- and trans-disciplinary collaboration is emphasized to ensure these technologies are effective, sustainable, and equitable in supporting ecosystem conservation and restoration efforts addressing global ecological crises.},

Mapping and monitoring these critical coastal habitats are essential for sustainable management and conservation efforts. This study employed the Google Earth Engine ({GEE}) cloud platform with high-resolution multispectral satellite imagery (Sentinel-2 data with 10 m spatial resolution), Airborne Laser Terrain Mapper ({ALTM}) elevation data with 5 m resolution, and advanced machine learning ({ML}) algorithms used to map the distribution and extent of coastal green infrastructure along the Pondicherry coastline in southern India. A random forest ({RF}) classifier was trained on a diverse set of reference data (70\% for training and 30\% for validation) collected through extensive field surveys and visual interpretation of very high-resolution aerial imagery. The model integrated spectral information from multiple satellite sensors along with derived biophysical indices to accurately delineate different coastal vegetation types. The resulting maps revealed detailed spatial patterns of mangroves, sand dunes, and coastal plantations with an overall accuracy exceeding 90\% verified with the field data. Analyses quantified their spatial coverage and fragmentation along the study area. This high-resolution, accurate baseline data can inform coastal management strategies, including targeted conservation efforts, ecological restoration projects, climate change adaptation planning, and sustainable development practices that preserve vital green infrastructure. The workflow demonstrated the robust capabilities of {ML} methods coupled with multi-source remote sensing data for effectively mapping complex and dynamic coastal ecosystems at a regional scale. The techniques can be adapted for other coastal regions to understand green infrastructure dynamics better and support evidence-based policies promoting ecological and community resilience.},

	abstract = {Spatiotemporal information on mangrove species assemblage of natural, disturbed, and rehabilitated is an essential prerequisite for effective strategies for biodiversity conservation and management. However, appropriate field‐based sampling strategies of spatial heterogeneity still hamper the detection of the species distribution and its temporal development. An increasing amount of remote sensing data seems the perfect way to tackle these challenges. With this article, we fill this gap by presenting a review of the challenges and limitations to assess the current status of species diversity. We conclude that species discrimination based on remote sensing techniques is still limited by atmospheric contamination and tidal fluctuations. The lack of accurate information on the spatiotemporal development of species diversity and forest structure further curtails an understanding of functional indicators and the predictive power of modeling approaches. Nevertheless, multi‐source remote‐sensing techniques could seemingly capture the landscape heterogeneity and support systematic sampling designs. Spatially balanced (systematic) training and validation data are necessary to compile robust spatiotemporal information, supporting reliable predictions for optimizing restoration efforts. A systematic sampling of spatiotemporal ecological information is vital to derive the historical state of mangroves, detecting their degradation, and predicting future patterns of species distribution that are generally crucial for restoration, and particularly to rehabilitate species diversity.},

	abstract = {Mangroves are indispensable to coastlines, maintaining biodiversity, and mitigating climate change. Therefore, improving the accuracy of mangrove information identification is crucial for their ecological protection. Aiming at the limited morphological information of synthetic aperture radar ({SAR}) images, which is greatly interfered by noise, and the susceptibility of optical images to weather and lighting conditions, this paper proposes a pixel-level weighted fusion method for {SAR} and optical images. Image fusion enhanced the target features and made mangrove monitoring more comprehensive and accurate. To address the problem of high similarity between mangrove forests and other forests, this paper is based on the U-Net convolutional neural network, and an attention mechanism is added in the feature extraction stage to make the model pay more attention to the mangrove vegetation area in the image. In order to accelerate the convergence and normalize the input, batch normalization ({BN}) layer and Dropout layer are added after each convolutional layer. Since mangroves are a minority class in the image, an improved cross-entropy loss function is introduced in this paper to improve the model’s ability to recognize mangroves. The {AttU}-Net model for mangrove recognition in high similarity environments is thus constructed based on the fused images. Through comparison experiments, the overall accuracy of the improved U-Net model trained from the fused images to recognize the predicted regions is significantly improved. Based on the fused images, the recognition results of the {AttU}-Net model proposed in this paper are compared with its benchmark model, U-Net, and the Dense-Net, Res-Net, and Seg-Net methods. The {AttU}-Net model captured mangroves’ complex structures and textural features in images more effectively. The average {OA}, F1-score, and Kappa coefficient in the four tested regions were 94.406\%, 90.006\%, and 84.045\%, which were significantly higher than several other methods. This method can provide some technical support for the monitoring and protection of mangrove ecosystems.},

Although remote sensing in the thermal infrared ({TIR}) domain can offer novel insights into the impacts of changing surface temperatures on vegetation, the transformative potential of remote sensing for plant ecology has not yet been realized. Remotely sensed surface temperatures can be used to derive stomatal behaviour and identify stressful environmental conditions in near-real time. Plant species, traits and structural characteristics can be evaluated with high spectral resolution {TIR} emissivity. Beyond canopy scales, thermal remote sensing can enhance the inferences obtained from manipulative experiments and empirical evidence, providing unique insight into shifts in species ranges and phenology with changing climate conditions. Scaling leaf traits, canopy structure and regional patterns require an integrated understanding of both process and technology. Theory linking surface temperatures to vegetation dynamics is summarized from an energy balance perspective. We outline scaling considerations including the impacts of morphology on leaf energy balance, canopy structure influences on convective heat exchange and potential confounding impacts of non-vegetated surfaces. Synthesis. We introduce a unifying framework to link leaf to globe through thermal remote sensing. Recent and emerging advances in sensors, data availability and analytics, together with synergies between {TIR} remote sensing and other data sources, present a timely opportunity for ecologists to advance our understanding of plant physiology, ecology and biogeography with thermal remote sensing.},

	abstract = {Mangrove forests in many parts of the world are declining at an alarming rate—possibly even more rapidly than inland tropical forests. The rate and causes of such changes are not known. The forests themselves are dynamic in nature and are undergoing constant changes due to both natural and anthropogenic forces. Our research objective was to monitor deforestation and degradation arising from both natural and anthropogenic forces. We analyzed multi-temporal satellite data from 1970s, 1990s, and 2000s using supervised classification approach. Our spatio-temporal analysis shows that despite having the highest population density in the world in its periphery, areal extent of the mangrove forest of the Sundarbans has not changed significantly (approximately 1.2\%) in the last ∼25years. The forest is however constantly changing due to erosion, aggradation, deforestation and mangrove rehabilitation programs. The net forest area increased by 1.4\% from the 1970s to 1990 and decreased by 2.5\% from 1990 to 2000. The change is insignificant in the context of classification errors and the dynamic nature of mangrove forests. This is an excellent example of the co-existence of humans with terrestrial and aquatic plant and animal life. The strong commitment of governments under various protection measures such as forest reserves, wildlife sanctuaries, national parks, and international designations, is believed to be responsible for keeping this forest relatively intact (at least in terms of area). While the measured net loss of mangrove forest is not that high, the change matrix shows that turnover due to erosion, aggradation, reforestation and deforestation was much greater than net change. The forest is under threat from natural and anthropogenic forces leading to forest degradation, primarily due to top-dying disease and over-exploitation of forest resources.},

Location: Global, covering 99\% of all mangrove forests. Methods: We synthesized the Global Forest Change database, the Terrestrial Ecosystems of the World database and the Mangrove Forests of the World database to extract mangrove forest cover at high spatial and temporal resolutions. We then used the new database to monitor mangrove cover at the global, national and protected area scales. Results: Countries showing relatively high amounts of mangrove loss include Myanmar, Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia and Guatemala. Indonesia remains by far the largest mangrove-holding nation, containing between 26\% and 29\% of the global mangrove inventory with a deforestation rate of between 0.26\% and 0.66\% per year. We have made our new database, {CGMFC}-21, freely available. Main conclusions: Global mangrove deforestation continues but at a much reduced rate of between 0.16\% and 0.39\% per year. Southeast Asia is a region of concern with mangrove deforestation rates between 3.58\% and 8.08\%, this in a region containing half of the entire global mangrove forest inventory. The global mangrove deforestation pattern from 2000 to 2012 is one of decreasing rates of deforestation, with many nations essentially stable, with the exception of the largest mangrove-holding region of Southeast Asia. We provide a standardized spatial dataset that monitors mangrove deforestation globally at high spatio-temporal resolutions.

	abstract = {Mangrove forests are vital ecosystems with the highest global carbon absorption capacity, playing a crucial role in climate change mitigation. Therefore, their conservation and management are essential. However, as mangroves are primarily found in tropical regions, frequent cloud cover and limited accessibility pose significant challenges to effective monitoring using optical satellite imagery. In addition, many developing countries with extensive mangrove coverage face challenges in conducting precise monitoring due to limited technological infrastructure. To overcome these limitations, this study integrated open-access synthetic aperture radar ({SAR}) data with optical imagery to enhance the classification accuracy of mangrove forests in the Bali Denpasar–Badung region. The Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 datasets were used, and the U-Net deep learning model was employed for training and classification. A digital elevation model ({DEM}) from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission ({SRTM}) was applied to exclude areas higher than 10 m above sea level, thereby improving the classification accuracy. Additionally, a time-series analysis was performed to assess changes in the mangrove distribution over the past decade, revealing a consistent increase in mangrove extent in the study area. The classification performance was evaluated using a confusion matrix, demonstrating that the combined {SAR}-optical model outperformed single-source models across all key metrics including precision, accuracy, recall, and F1-score. The findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating {SAR} and optical data for capturing the complex ecological and geographical characteristics of mangrove forests. Notably, {SAR} imagery, which is resistant to cloud cover, shows considerable potential for independent application in tropical mangrove monitoring, warranting further research to explore its capabilities in greater depth.},

	abstract = {Mangroves play a critical role in maintaining biodiversity, supporting global carbon and nitrogen cycles, and contributing to the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals ({SDGs}). Accurate estimation of their nitrogen and phosphorus content is essential for assessing the status of mangrove ecosystems. However, the spectral response characteristics of mangrove leaf nitrogen content ({LNC}) and leaf phosphorus content ({LPC}) remain unclear. These knowledge gaps hinder the development of robust predictive models across diverse environmental contexts. To overcome these issues, we collected 375 samples and 16,590 in situ full-spectrum hyperspectral data, and further proposed a novel Global-Fractional Order Sensitivity Analysis (G-{FOSA}) method. We analyzed for the first time the apparent and deep spectral characteristics of {LNC} and {LPC} for four typical mangrove species in China (Avicennia marina, Acanthus ilicifolius, Kandelia candel and Aegiceras corniculatum) using G-{FOSA} method. This study revealed that the {LNC} diagnostic wavelengths concentrated in the range of 697 nm–704 nm, while the {LPC} diagnostic wavelengths were mostly distributed between 691 nm–834 nm and 1869 nm–2236 nm. We developed a mechanism-guided retrieval framework based on these diagnostic wavelengths, and achieved the quantitative inversion from field diagnostic wavelengths to optical satellite ({SDGSAT}-1 and Sentinel-2) bands. Our experiment results confirmed that {SDGSAT}-1, the world's first science satellite dedicated to serving the 2030 Agenda for {SDGs}, performs better in estimating {LNC} and {LPC} (R2 = 0.63). Finally, we utilized the advantages of cross-scenario transfer learning technology to design a novel domain adaptive transfer learning ({DTL}) model, which realized the cross-scenario retrieval of mangrove {LNC} and {LPC} across three typical mangrove regions, reducing estimation error ({RMSE}) by 0.6 \%–41.1 \% compared to the traditional {FTL} model. Our work provides new insights and a scientific basis for global mangrove conservation.},
