\section{Aim}
The aim of this paper is to assess the status of the technologies and analysis techniques used in determining the conservation status and restoration needs of mangrove forests; 
as well as identifying research gaps.
\subsection{Objectives}
The first objective is to review and assess the current completeness and robustness of various available datasets. 
Several factors can affect data access and analysis, such as cloud cover and shadows when comparing satellite data. These limitations can hinder the consistency of images required for continuous change monitoring.
Secondly, we aim to identify the technologies used for mangrove identification and conservation, as well as the computational modules used to analyse these datasets and gauge their performance. 
Additionally, we aim to outline the current challenges of measurement tools and computational analysis methods to elaborate on the main existing research gaps.
