\section{Aim}
The aim of this paper is to assess the status of the technologies and analysis techniques used in determining the conservation status and restoration needs of mangrove forests; 
as well as identifying research gaps.
\subsection{Objectives}
1. The first objective is reviewing and determining the current completeness and robustness of different available datasets.
Since there are several factors that can alter the access and analysis of data, such as the presence of clouds and shadows when trying to compare data collected by satellites, 
since they limit the consistency of available images required for continuos change monitoring. \cite{pimple_enhancing_2023}
