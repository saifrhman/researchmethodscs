Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the most widely used models in the field and are the foundation of most mangrove classification approaches. 
However, they struggle to detect small and fragmented mangroves resulting in incorrect classifications.  \cite{zhang_fragmangro_2025}

Another limitation encountered was when analysing underwater scanning. Given that mangroves are predominantly submerged, satellite scanning is not accurate in terms of depth. \cite{pimple_enhancing_2023}
