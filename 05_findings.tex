Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the most widely used models in the field and form the foundation of most mangrove classification approaches; however, they struggle to detect small and fragmented mangroves resulting in incorrect classifications \cite{zhang_fragmangro_2025}. This limitation leads to three sub-challenges: the difficulty of distinguishing small patches of mangroves in complex backgrounds; the inefficiency of manual labelling in deep learning model training; and models developed or trained using data from one specific geographic region failing to perform well when applied to a different region with different characteristics  \cite{zhang_fragmangro_2025}.

Another limitation is encountered when analysing underwater scanning. Satellite data relies primarily on visible light and some wavelengths which are typically scattered by water resulting in poor accuracy for underwater mangroves. \cite{pimple_enhancing_2023}.

Furthermore, field validation and cross-referencing with local knowledge are necessary as some communities continue to explore methods for partial restoration. This can shape projects to maximise the benefits of identification and conservation of mangroves \cite{leal_state_2024}.
